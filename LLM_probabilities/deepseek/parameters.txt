Based on the evaluation graph and the given data, we can infer the following values for the alpha and beta parameters:

alpha_1=0.3
alpha_2=0.2
alpha_3=0.4
alpha_4=0.1
beta_1=0.5
beta_2=0.3
beta_3=0.6
beta_4=0.4

These values are derived from the distribution of the metrics in the evaluation graph, where the normalized-length and opportunity metrics have a moderate influence, the frequency penalty has a higher influence, and the overlap penalty has a lower influence. The beta values are set to reflect the relative importance of each metric, with the frequency penalty being the most important and the overlap penalty the least.

To determine the values of alpha and beta, we need to analyze the patterns in the metrics from the Evaluation Graph. Here's a step-by-step approach to infer these values:

1. **Normalized-length (alpha_1, beta_1)**:
   - The normalized-length values are mostly around 0.3, with a few higher values (0.7, 1.0). This suggests that longer runs are less common but potentially more influential.
   - Beta_1 should be set higher (e.g., 0.7) to favor longer runs, as they are less frequent but likely more important.

2. **Opportunity (alpha_2, beta_2)**:
   - Opportunity values are mostly low (around 0.01-0.03), with some higher values (0.33). Higher opportunity indicates more frequent chances for a run to be selected.
   - Beta_2 should be set lower (e.g., 0.2) to favor runs with higher opportunity, as they are more likely to be selected.

3. **Frequencypenalty (alpha_3, beta_3)**:
   - Frequencypenalty values are mostly high (around 0.8-0.9), indicating that runs are penalized for being too frequent.
   - Beta_3 should be set higher (e.g., 0.8) to favor runs with lower frequency penalties, as they are less penalized.

4. **Overlappenalty (alpha_4, beta_4)**:
   - Overlappenalty values are mostly 0.0, with some higher values (0.2-0.5). Higher overlap penalties are undesirable.
   - Beta_4 should be set lower (e.g., 0.1) to minimize overlap penalties, as they are generally undesirable.

5. **Alpha weights**:
   - Given the importance of avoiding overlap and favoring longer runs, alpha_1 and alpha_4 should be higher.
   - Opportunity and frequencypenalty are less critical, so alpha_2 and alpha_3 can be lower.

Based on this analysis, the inferred values are:

alpha_1=0.4
alpha_2=0.1
alpha_3=0.2
alpha_4=0.3
beta_1=0.7
beta_2=0.2
beta_3=0.8
beta_4=0.1
